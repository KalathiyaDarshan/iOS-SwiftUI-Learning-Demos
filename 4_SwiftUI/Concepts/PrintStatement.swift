// MARK: - print Statement in Swift vs. SwiftUI -

/*
 
 âœ… Works the same in Swift and SwiftUI, but with some differences in behavior due to SwiftUIâ€™s declarative nature.
 
 In Swift (Imperative Approach)
 print() runs once when the function is called.
 
 func greetUser() {
 print("Hello, user!") // Prints once when called
 }
 
 greetUser()
 
 âœ… Console Output:
 Hello, user!
 
 In SwiftUI (Declarative & View Re-renders)
 print() inside body runs multiple times because SwiftUI recomputes views when state changes.
 
 struct ContentView: View {
 var body: some View {
 let _ = print("SwiftUI View is recomputed")
 return Text("Hello, SwiftUI!")
 }
 }
 
 âœ… Console Output:
 SwiftUI View is recomputed
 SwiftUI View is recomputed
 ...
 
 SwiftUI updates views when state changes, so print() might execute multiple times.
 ðŸ’¡ Best Practice: Use onAppear or debugPrint() for debugging in SwiftUI instead.
 
 Text("Hello, SwiftUI!")
 .onAppear { print("View appeared!") }
