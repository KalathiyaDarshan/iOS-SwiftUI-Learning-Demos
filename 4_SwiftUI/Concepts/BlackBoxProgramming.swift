// MARK: - Black Box Programming in Swift vs. SwiftUI -

/*
 
 Black Box Programming refers to the idea of creating systems where the internal workings of a component or function are hidden from the user or developer.
 The focus is on defining clear inputs and outputs, with little concern or exposure of how the system works internally.
 This is often done to simplify usage and to allow developers to focus on functionality rather than implementation details.
 
 In both Swift and SwiftUI, black box programming can be applied, but the use cases and scenarios differ slightly due to the nature of the two environments.
 
 // MARK: - 1Ô∏è‚É£ Black Box Programming in Swift -
 //###############################################################################
 
 In Swift, black box programming is most commonly associated with abstracting functionality and hiding implementation details. This is typically achieved through encapsulation, protocols, and other object-oriented design patterns. When working in Swift, the goal is often to separate the interface (what the user or developer interacts with) from the implementation (how it actually works), making the internal workings of a class or function less important to the user.
 
 // MARK: - ‚úÖ Use Cases of Black Box Programming in Swift: -
 
 Encapsulation:
 Using classes, structs, and protocols to hide implementation details.
 
 Libraries and Frameworks:
 Developing reusable code where the user of the library does not need to understand its inner workings.
 
 Custom Types and Data Structures:
 Encapsulating logic for managing data while exposing only necessary interfaces.
 
 Error Handling:
 Wrapping complex error-prone code in a function or class and exposing simple, clean error messages.
 
 // A black-boxed class that encapsulates the internal logic
 class PaymentProcessor {
 func processPayment(amount: Double) -> Bool {
 // Internal processing logic hidden from the user
 // Assume complex logic for processing payment
 return amount > 0 // Simple output based on input
 }
 }
 
 // Client code that uses the payment processor without knowing how it works
 let processor = PaymentProcessor()
 let success = processor.processPayment(amount: 100.0)
 print(success) // Output: true
 
 In this example:
 The PaymentProcessor class abstracts away the internal logic of processing payments.
 The client code only interacts with the public interface (processPayment), not worrying about how the payment is processed internally.
 The black-box behavior hides the complexity and allows the focus to be on functionality.
 
 // MARK: - ‚úÖ Key Points in Swift: -
 
 Encapsulation:
 The idea of hiding data and implementation within classes and structs.
 
 Protocols:
 Hiding specific implementations and exposing only the required behaviors.
 
 Libraries/Frameworks:
 Creating reusable code where users interact with APIs without needing to know internal details.

 In SwiftUI, black box programming typically focuses on abstracting view components and view logic.
 SwiftUI's declarative nature makes it especially suited for black-box programming, where developers define what the UI should do without worrying about how it updates or renders.
 The internal state and layout calculations are managed by SwiftUI itself, and developers interact with it through bindings, state management, and view declarations.
 
 // MARK: - ‚úÖ Use Cases of Black Box Programming in SwiftUI: -
 
 Views:
 Views in SwiftUI are treated as black boxes. You declare the layout and content, and SwiftUI handles rendering and updates automatically.
 
 Modifiers:
 Custom view modifiers can encapsulate complex logic, hiding their internal implementation.
 
 State Management:
 SwiftUI handles state updates, making it easy to manage UI changes without manually handling layout updates.
 
 Animations:
 Animations in SwiftUI can be treated as black boxes, where you specify the desired effects, and SwiftUI handles the details of how the animation is performed.
 
 import SwiftUI
 
 // A simple black-boxed button that handles state internally
 struct ToggleButton: View {
 @State private var isOn = false
 
 var body: some View {
 Button(action: {
 isOn.toggle()
 }) {
 Text(isOn ? "On" : "Off")
 .padding()
 .background(isOn ? Color.green : Color.red)
 .foregroundColor(.white)
 .cornerRadius(10)
 }
 }
 }
 
 // Main view using the black-boxed ToggleButton
 struct ContentView: View {
 var body: some View {
 VStack {
 ToggleButton() // User interacts with this component without worrying about internal state
 }
 }
 }
 
 struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
 static var previews: some View {
 ContentView()
 }
 }
 
 In this example:
 The ToggleButton view is a black box: the internal state (isOn) is managed within the view, and the UI updates based on that state.
 The developer doesn‚Äôt need to understand how the button handles state changes, it is abstracted away by SwiftUI's state management system.
 The client code (in ContentView) simply interacts with the button without needing to handle the internal details of the state or UI updates.
 
 // MARK: - ‚úÖ Key Points in SwiftUI: -
 
 Declarative Views:
 You describe what you want, and SwiftUI handles the underlying logic (rendering, state management).
 
 State and Binding:
 @State and @Binding are used to manage internal states in views without exposing details to the rest of the code.
 
 Modifiers:
 SwiftUI modifiers are often used as black-boxed components to apply common behaviors (like colors, padding, etc.) to views.
 
 // MARK: - 3Ô∏è‚É£ Key Differences: Black Box Programming in Swift vs. SwiftUI -
 //###############################################################################
 
 Focus:
 Swift: Hiding the implementation of business logic, data manipulation, and networking.
 SwiftUI: Hiding the details of view rendering, layout, and state management.
 
 Encapsulation:
 Swift: Typically achieved through classes, structs, and protocols.
 SwiftUI: Achieved through views, modifiers, and state management.
 
 User Interaction:
 Swift: Users interact with abstracted logic and APIs without worrying about how it's implemented.
 SwiftUI: Users interact with views without worrying about the internal state or rendering logic.
 
 State Management:
 Swift: State is often managed manually or using MVVM, Observer, or other patterns.
 SwiftUI: SwiftUI manages the state automatically using @State, @Binding, and @ObservedObject.
 
 Main Use Cases:
 Swift: Encapsulating business logic, managing models, and providing reusable frameworks.
 SwiftUI: Encapsulating UI logic, simplifying layout and state updates, and creating reusable views.
 
 // MARK: - üîπ Summary -
 //###############################################################################
 
 In Swift, black box programming is about abstracting logic, business rules, and data manipulation. The internal workings are hidden within functions, classes, or libraries, and users interact with a simple, clean API.
 
 In SwiftUI, black box programming focuses on abstracting view behavior and state management. The declarative nature of SwiftUI hides most of the internal complexities of rendering, layout, and animation, allowing developers to focus on what the UI should do rather than how it‚Äôs implemented.
 
 Both in Swift and SwiftUI, black box programming helps simplify development by focusing on inputs and outputs while hiding internal complexities, but in Swift, the focus is on data and business logic, while in SwiftUI, it‚Äôs on view composition and UI behavior.
