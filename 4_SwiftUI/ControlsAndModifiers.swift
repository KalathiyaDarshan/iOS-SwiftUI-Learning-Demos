 Identify performance issue:
 1. Profiling with Instruments - Time Profiler - Core Animation - Leaks -
 2. Identifying SwiftUI-Specific Issues - Redraws and Layout Updates -
 Simplify View Hierarchy Complexity - Check Excessive State Changes
 3. Strategies for Optimization - Reduce View Updates - Lazy Loading and
 Pagination - Image and Asset Optimization - Use Instruments Iteratively
 4. Continuous Testing and Profiling - Real Device Testing - Regular
 Profiling
 Debug a SwiftUI view:
 Using SwiftUI Previews
 Print Statements and Debugging Logs
